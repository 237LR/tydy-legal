## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create my first cleaning task?**
A: Tap the Tasks tab, then tap the "+" button. Enter your task details, set frequency if recurring, and save. Your task will appear in your task list.

**Q: What is the Cleanliness Score?**
A: Your Cleanliness Score (0-100) reflects your cleaning consistency and task completion. It increases when you complete tasks and decreases with inactivity or overdue tasks.

**Q: How does the Daily Sparkle work?**
A: Daily Sparkle is a bonus micro-task that changes daily (like "wipe light switches"). Complete it for 10 bonus points and a satisfying animation.

### Premium Features

**Q: What's included with Tydy Premium?**
A: Premium includes unlimited tasks, full AI photo analysis, advanced Clean Cards, priority support, and premium visual themes.

**Q: How do I upgrade to Premium?**
A: Go to Profile > Subscription in the app and select your preferred plan (weekly, monthly, or yearly).

**Q: Can I cancel my subscription anytime?**
A: Yes, cancel through your Apple ID Account Settings. You'll retain premium features until your subscription period ends.

### AI Assistant

**Q: How does the AI photo analysis work?**
A: Take a photo of a messy area, and our AI provides step-by-step cleaning instructions, time estimates, and tool recommendations.

**Q: Are my photos stored or shared?**
A: No, photos are processed immediately and deleted. We don't store your photos on our servers.

**Q: Why isn't the AI working?**
A: Ensure you have camera permissions enabled and a stable internet connection. AI analysis requires an active connection to process images.

### Tasks and Scoring

**Q: Why did my score decrease?**
A: Scores naturally decay over time without activity (10 points per day) and decrease when tasks become overdue (-5 points per overdue task).

**Q: How do streaks work?**
A: Complete tasks consistently to build streaks. Longer streaks provide bonus points (20% for 3+ days, 50% for 7+ days).

**Q: Can I edit or delete tasks?**
A: Yes, tap on any task to edit its details or swipe left to delete it.

### Daily Clean Boost Timer

**Q: Can I use the 5-minute timer multiple times per day?**
A: Yes! You can use the timer as many times as you want, but points are only awarded for the first completion each day.

**Q: What if I leave the app during the timer?**
A: The timer continues running in the background and will resume when you return to the app.
